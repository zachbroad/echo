## Tech Stack

ECHO is built with a cutting-edge tech stack to provide the best possible user experience:

- **Frontend:** The frontend of the app is built with ReactJS for its efficiency and flexibility in building user
  interfaces. It is styled using Bootstrap a CSS framework for rapidly building modern responsive user interfaces.
- **Backend:** The backend is powered by Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and
  clean, pragmatic design. With Django, we're able to manage user accounts, handle API requests, and maintain reliable
  connections with Spotify's API.
- **Database:** We use PostgreSQL, an open source relational database, due to its extensibility and standards
  compliance.
